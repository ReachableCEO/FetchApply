# TSYS FetchApply Security Documentation

## Security Architecture

The TSYS FetchApply infrastructure provisioning system is designed with security-first principles, implementing multiple layers of protection for server deployment and management.

## Current Security Features

### 1. Secure Deployment Method ✅
- **Git-based deployment:** Uses `git clone` instead of `curl | bash`
- **Local execution:** Scripts run locally after inspection
- **Version control:** Full audit trail of changes
- **Code review:** Changes require explicit approval

### 2. HTTPS Enforcement ✅
- **All downloads use HTTPS:** Eliminates man-in-the-middle attacks
- **SSL certificate validation:** Automatic certificate checking
- **Secure repositories:** Ubuntu archive, Dell, Proxmox all use HTTPS
- **No HTTP fallbacks:** No insecure download methods

### 3. SSH Hardening
- **Key-only authentication:** Password login disabled
- **Secure ciphers:** Modern encryption algorithms only
- **Fail2ban protection:** Automated intrusion prevention
- **Custom SSH configuration:** Hardened sshd_config

### 4. System Security
- **Firewall configuration:** Automated iptables rules
- **Audit logging:** auditd with custom rules
- **SIEM integration:** Wazuh agent deployment
- **Compliance scanning:** SCAP-STIG automated checks

### 5. Error Handling
- **Bash strict mode:** `set -euo pipefail` prevents errors
- **Centralized logging:** All operations logged with timestamps
- **Graceful failures:** Proper cleanup on errors
- **Line-level debugging:** Error reporting with line numbers

## Security Testing

### Automated Security Validation
```bash
# Run security test suite
./Project-Tests/run-tests.sh security

# Specific security tests
./Project-Tests/security/https-enforcement.sh
```

### Security Test Categories
1. **HTTPS Enforcement:** Validates all URLs use HTTPS
2. **Deployment Security:** Checks for secure deployment methods
3. **SSL Certificate Validation:** Tests certificate authenticity
4. **Permission Validation:** Verifies proper file permissions

## Threat Model

### Mitigated Threats
- **Supply Chain Attacks:** Git-based deployment with review
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** HTTPS-only downloads
- **Privilege Escalation:** Proper permission models
- **Unauthorized Access:** SSH hardening and key management

### Remaining Risks
- **Secrets in Repository:** SSH keys stored in git (planned for removal)
- **No Integrity Verification:** Downloads lack checksum validation
- **No Backup/Recovery:** No rollback capability implemented

## Security Recommendations

### High Priority
1. **Implement Secrets Management**
   - Remove SSH keys from repository
   - Use Bitwarden/Vault for secret storage
   - Implement key rotation procedures

2. **Add Download Integrity Verification**
   - SHA256 checksum validation for all downloads
   - GPG signature verification where available
   - Fail-safe on integrity check failures

3. **Enhance Audit Logging**
   - Centralized log collection
   - Real-time security monitoring
   - Automated threat detection

### Medium Priority
1. **Configuration Backup**
   - System state snapshots before changes
   - Rollback capability for failed deployments
   - Configuration drift detection

2. **Network Security**
   - VPN-based deployment (where applicable)
   - Network segmentation for management
   - Encrypted communication channels

## Compliance

### Security Standards
- **CIS Benchmarks:** Automated compliance checking
- **STIG Guidelines:** SCAP-based validation
- **Industry Best Practices:** Following NIST cybersecurity framework

### Audit Requirements
- **Change Tracking:** All modifications logged
- **Access Control:** Permission-based system access
- **Vulnerability Management:** Regular security assessments

## Incident Response

### Security Event Handling
1. **Detection:** Automated monitoring and alerting
2. **Containment:** Immediate isolation procedures
3. **Investigation:** Log analysis and forensics
4. **Recovery:** System restoration procedures
5. **Lessons Learned:** Process improvement

## Security Development Lifecycle

### Code Review Process
1. **Static Analysis:** Automated security scanning
2. **Peer Review:** Manual code inspection
3. **Security Testing:** Automated security test suite
4. **Approval:** Security team sign-off

### Deployment Security
1. **Pre-deployment Validation:** Security test execution
2. **Secure Deployment:** Authorized personnel only
3. **Post-deployment Verification:** Security configuration validation
4. **Monitoring:** Continuous security monitoring

## Security Tools and Integrations

- **auditd:** System call auditing
- **Fail2ban:** Intrusion prevention

### Planned Integrations
- **Vault/Bitwarden:** Secrets management
- **OSSEC:** Host-based intrusion detection
- **Nessus/OpenVAS:** Vulnerability scanning
- **ELK Stack:** Log aggregation and analysis

## Vulnerability Management

### Vulnerability Scanning
- **Regular scans:** Monthly vulnerability assessments
- **Automated patching:** Security update automation
- **Exception handling:** Risk-based patch management
- **Reporting:** Executive security dashboards

### Disclosure Process
1. **Internal Discovery:** Report to security team
2. **Assessment:** Risk and impact evaluation
3. **Remediation:** Patch development and testing
4. **Deployment:** Coordinated security updates
5. **Verification:** Post-patch validation
